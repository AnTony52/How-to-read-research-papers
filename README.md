# How-to-read-research-papers
Begin with 2 questions:
1. What did authors do in this paper?
2. What did authors find?
So that means a research paper have to read 2 times.
Read orders: First time: 1.Title 2. Abtract 3. Conclusion
             Second time: *read in details.
                          *Go in math formulas, methods. 
                          *Avoid unknown key words. But if it being repeated many times then i might be an important word. Search for that word later.
